## Thesis Title
### Vision Transformer-based Retinal Prosthetic Simulation with Predicted Visual Fixations

## Description
The objective is to propose a method to enhance the output of the prosthetic model for patients with retinal impairment. To this end, a ViT model is implemented to simulate the human visual focus (fixation) based on its attention map. The simulation, which is based on the self-supervision DINOv2 and the ImageNet-1k dataset, and the proposed method, which incorporates a U-net encoder, constitute 5 pipelines that are analyzed by multiple experiments and an ablation study.

## Authors and Acknowledgment
This project employs the ViT model from https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2 and the U-net model from https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet, with certain modifications to enable the models to function within the scope of the experiments conducted for this thesis.

## Project Status
The thesis has been completed.
